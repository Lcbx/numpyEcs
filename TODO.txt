* idea : apply directional shadow map on the AO buffer ? (simple + blur comes free)
* add frustum culling
* batch same shader calls (raylib does so for static meshes under the hood iirc)
* use openAL for binaural audio
* use bullet for physics (at first ; maybe migrate to ctypes & jolt later)
* add a particle system
* implement msaa (not sure it's worth it -> on the backburner)
