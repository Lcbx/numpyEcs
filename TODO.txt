* single shadow camera take 50% (and AO 30%) of frame time...
* implement msaa (not sure it's worth it? -> on the backburner)
* move AO computation into main pass ? can't blur it then though
* move cascaded shadowmap in AO buffer so we can bundle the depth aware pass together ?
* add frustum culling
* batch same shader calls (raylib does so for static meshes under the hood iirc)
* use openAL for binaural audio
* use bullet for physics (at first ; maybe migrate to ctypes & jolt later)
* add a particle system
